**Adding yourself to the favorite files**

**Steps**

1) Modify the favorites.json file in the hw2_simple_change folder. You will need to add a unique username key and your favorite movie characteristic. When you add a new line, but a comma on the previous line before adding to the bottom. See example below.

  *format:*
  ```
  "identikey_username": {
      "movie": "favorite movie name"
  }
  ```
  *example:*
  ```
  "afosdick": {
      "movie": "Wall-E"
  }
  ```
